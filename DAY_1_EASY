//Q1.What will be the output of the following code?

name = 'saif'
d = int(name)
print(type(d))

//Ans Error
//Explanation: We cannot convert a string into an integer.

//..................................................................................
//Q2.Predict the output by the following code snippet.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 5, c = 5;
    int d;
    d = b + c == a;
    cout << d;
}

//Ans 1
//Solution description
In this case, the first (b + c) is calculated, then the value is compared with 'a', as they are equal, the value of 'd' becomes 1.

//Q3.What is the output of the following for loop and range() function?

for num in range(2,-5,-1):
    print(num, end=", ")

//Ans 
2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4,

Solution description
Here we are iterating reverse from the start while iterating reverse we have to pass step size as negative.

Q5.What is the output of the following code?

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String argo[]) {
        int a = 50;
        int b = 100;
        int c = (a > b) ? a : b;

        System.out.println(c);
    }
}     

//Ans 100
//Solution description
//The above program simply finds the maximum among three numbers. It first checks if a is greater than b or not, if yes then print a else print b.
